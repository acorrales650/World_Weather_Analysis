# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
A travel app is created to assist potential customers in filtering prospective hotels in various cities around the world. An interactive filter is then created so that the customer can specify a certain kind of climate they might to like to visit based on a minimum and maximum temperature with which they would be comfortable.

## Purpose
After these select cities and hotels are established, the purpose of the project became to create a series of visually accessible maps for the customer's selections. First, a map of all the available hotels across the globe based on the specified parameters of minimum and maximum temperature.

Second, from these available cities, 4 cities were chosen to create a driving directional itinerary map using the same starting and ending points with 3 cities in between. For this project in particular, 4 cities in Argentina were chosen and a directional map was created: Cordoba (as the starting and ending point), Mercedes, Mar Del Plata, and Necochea.

Lastly, in the directional map, informational markers were inserted to show each city's information when selected.
